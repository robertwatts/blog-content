Hello. ‚úåüèª Welcome to my personal site.

My thing is building software with people. I spend most of time doing this as CTO at Wonderbly, where we help people share their love for each other through unique and beautiful books. [We're usually hiring](https://wonderbly.jobs.personio.com/).

Below is my [feed](https://indieweb.org/h-feed) of some things I do with the rest of my time.
